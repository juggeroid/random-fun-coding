# random coding
A bunch of small, personal projects which had to be done during the studies. Might also include algorithm's excerpts, re-written / forked projects, notes. Generally, this repository serves no purpose but to store the experiments, and I personally don't expect it to become something greater than this.  

Everything here should be re-written, without exceptions (haha no pun intended). Calculator used to be working, now it obviously doesn't.
